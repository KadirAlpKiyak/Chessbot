2 AI bots playing chess whit different openings

I write 3 specific codes that runs a chess game one for white side one for black side one for chess game whit each line of code i tried to use AI.

After some try i maanged to make these two sides win after 3-15 games. in game series more then 5 games are and whit draw but after that there is always a winner.

That shows us 2 same algorithm AI can be predictible for each other and make their own moves.
